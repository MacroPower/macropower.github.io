This has presented the need for a backup solution for any persistent data I might have there. For quite some time, I have been using Duplicati for my backups, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been completely content with its performance, and have heard many horror stories of restores not working properly. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to find a backup solution that worked well for my personal computers (I have Windows, Linux, and Darwin hosts), my storage servers (UnRaid and FreeNAS), as well as Kubernetes.</description></item></channel></rss>
