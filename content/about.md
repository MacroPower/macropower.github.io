I love open source. I make most of the stuff I do in my free time public on GitHub. There's a lot more detail about my current goals and projects on my [profile](https://github.com/MacroPower).

I have a homelab and am [slowly moving](https://github.com/MacroPower/homelab) to an entirely IaC, all K8s setup with HCloud and several NUCs. I use both unraid and freenas for 100TB+ persistent storage.

I enjoy movies/tv and rate almost everything I watch on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50852864/ratings?sort=your_rating,desc) & [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/MacroPower).

I like music, I am an [avid audiophile](https://www.head-fi.org/members/macropower.402314/#about) and I [collect](https://www.discogs.com/user/MacroPower/collection) and digitally process vinyl.
