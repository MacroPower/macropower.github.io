## Terminals

### Warp

https://www.warp.dev/

Things I don't like:

- Normally I'm not a stickler about these things, but I'm not sure how I feel about using a VC-backed, closed-source terminal that requires me to create an account to use it.
- You are basically required to pay for it if you want to use the AI features at any reasonable scale.

### Wave

https://www.waveterm.dev/

Why I think it's worth considering:

- It's kind of like Warp, but open source.
- Supports LocalAI.
- The code editor is also a nice feature for those of us who keep putting off learning vim.
- Overall I like the ideas behind most of the UI/UX decisions.

Things I don't like:

- There's very little customization, virtually zero ability to theme it.
- Only supports bash, not zsh or fish.

### iTerm2

https://iterm2.com/

Why I think it's worth considering:

- Incredibly popular and well-supported.
- Highly customizable.
- OpenAI integration.

Things I don't like:

- The OpenAI integration is very clunky at the moment.
- No support for LocalAI.

### Kitty

https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

Why I think it's worth considering:

- Very fast and GPU-accelerated.
- Highly customizable.
- Includes support for [extensions](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#extending-kitty).

Things I don't like:

- Kitty's entire UI is rendered in the terminal itself, including things like tabs.
- Does not support blurrable backgrounds (lol).

### Alacritty

https://alacritty.org/

To be honest after researching this, I don't see why you'd use it over Kitty.

### Hyper

https://hyper.is/

Things I don't like:

- Electron

### Cogno

https://cogno.rocks/

Things I don't like:

- The community is very small.
- Electron

### Contour

https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour/



## Shells

### Fish

Why I think it's worth considering:

- It's simple and for the most part "just works" with very little configuration.
- It is highly customizable, even though the out-of-the-box experience is quite good.
- Fisher is a great package manager (comparatively).

Things I don't like:

- Its syntax can be a little annoying. Frequently I have to just `bash -c ''` things.

### Zsh

Things I don't like:

- Requires a lot of configuration to get it to a point where it's as useful as Fish OOTB.
- Ecosystem is absolutely massive and it frequently feels like 80% of it is abandoned/deprecated.
