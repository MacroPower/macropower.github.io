## Things that are missing (?)

- path functions like join, basename.

- inline function calls + type casting

- I have to reference config for it to be accessible in mixins. why?

- mod files are TOML (nit I guess)

- lock files behave strangely when you call one package from another, updates seem to be very random

- references to git repos in mod file can't select subdirectories

- Some way to use shorthand to access values in a list, e.g. `foo.0.bar = "baz"` == `{ foo = [{ bar = "baz" }] }`

- code highlighting breaks randomly

Hello! I just purchased a new T-Mobile plan and selected "transfer number" at checkout, but I just got a new phone number. I was wondering if you could help me port my phone number from AT&T? I already "unlocked" my phone, but then I dialed *PORT per their instructions but was told that my number was not eligible for porting. I'm not sure what to do next. Thanks!


IMEI number
356479104149931

User 937.207.2639

I canâ€™t find a pin number but a good guess would be 4807 which is last 4 of the account or try 6478 or the last four of my phone 2639


The temporary PIN you requested is 0295
