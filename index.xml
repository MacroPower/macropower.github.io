I make most of the stuff I do in my free time public on GitHub. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more detail about my current goals and projects on my profile.
I have a homelab and am slowly moving to an entirely IaC, all K8s setup with HCloud and several NUCs. I use both unraid and freenas for 100TB+ persistent storage.
I enjoy movies/tv and rate almost everything I watch on IMDB &amp;amp; MAL.</description></item><item><title>CV</title><link>https://jacobcolvin.com/cv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobcolvin.com/cv/</guid><description>Source code â€¢ Download / View in Browser

ltrace -i -C ./baby We&amp;rsquo;re prompted and can start off by inserting random value, e.g. asd.
A call to strcmp is intercepted by ltrace.
strcmp(&amp;#34;asd\n&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ab[REDACTED]13\n&amp;#34;) Let&amp;rsquo;s start by trying to pass ab[REDACTED]13.
In this case it was just that simple, and we receive the flag.
HTB{B[REDACTED]Z} There were probably a lot of additional ways this one could have been solved, and I think I got lucky by starting in this direction.</description></item></channel></rss>
